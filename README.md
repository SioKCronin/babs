[IN PROGRESS]

Bike Supply is a PyMC3-driven Bayesian predictive model of an urban bike share company's supply-demand dynamics. This model was built using public data supplied by Bay Area Bike Share. This model was built to answer the question - is it possible to build a model that predicts the volume of bikes entering and leaving a station for any given day of the year?
