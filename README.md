# Bike Supply

Bike Supply is a collection of predictive models of bike sharing supply-demand dynamics.

## Goal

The goal of this project is to build a model that predicts the number of bikes that will enter each station in the network within the next two hours. 

## Business problem 

Bike sharing programs reshuffle their supply to ensure bikes and docking stations are available throughout the day. This is typically carried out by a street team (and a mighty van). If it were possible to predict with some level of accuracy where bikes will be moving throughout the day, we could better optimize this reshuffling, especially during peak use times. 

## Model overview

Updated priors from today's bike rentals are used to adjust posterior distributions of today's arrivals

## Data

This model is being developed and validated with open data from [Bay Area Bike Share](http://www.bayareabikeshare.com/open-data). My hope is to tune this model to other [cities](https://github.com/BetaNYC/Bike-Share-Data-Best-Practices/wiki/Bike-Share-Data-Systems). But first things first, let's get this thing working!
